    // Even-length palindromes (centered between two characters)

}

// Expand Around Center

// Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) due to the double iteration (once for each character and once for each expansion).
// Space Complexity: O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space.
// The Expand Around Center approach is a time-efficient and space-efficient way to solve this problem compared to other potential approaches like Dynamic Programming (DP), especially for large inputs.
