Practice solving a variety of classic DP problems to reinforce these concepts and patterns:

- Knapsack Problem (0/1, Unbounded)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Coin Change
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Edit Distance
- Partition Problems (e.g., Partition Equal Subset Sum)
- Matrix Path Problems (e.g., Minimum Path Sum)
